Each of these examples should be executed in the following way:

1. Start the server by running server.r IN BATCH.  You can do this by
   executing `Rscript server.r` from a terminal.
2. Start the client by sourcing client.r INTERACTIVELY.  You can do this
   by starting an R session (Rstudio, wingui, R.app, ...) and running
   `source client.r`.
3. Pass commands from client to server by executing 
   `sendrecv(socket, "1+1")` from the client (replace "1+1" with the
   command of your choice, as a string).
4. Shut down the server by executing `sendrecv(socket, "EXIT")` on
   the client.

See the package vignette for more details.
